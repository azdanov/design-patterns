# Design Patterns

A set of common object-oriented experiences that help solve common programming challenges.

## Basics

* Abstraction - the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events
* Encapsulation - the action of enclosing something in or as if in a capsule
* Polymorphism - the condition of occurring in several different forms
* Inheritance - the practice of passing on functionality

## Principles

1.  Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same.
2.  Program to an interface, not an implementation.
3.  Favor composition over inheritance.

The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
